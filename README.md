# CrosswordGenerator
Generates a crossword puzzle based on user input words and clues.

Make sure the stdlib file is added as a library for the project, as stddraw is used for the graphics.

Start the program by running the main class. To change the input file, just edit fileName in main. You can add custom inputs
into the input folder, just use the format: word,clue,word,clue,...etc. as seen in the example inputs.

The clues, along with the completed board will be printed out, and the empty board will be displayed in a separate window.

Enjoy!
